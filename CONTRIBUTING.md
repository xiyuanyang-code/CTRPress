   guide below.

   contributions](#code-contributions) guide below. If you need more context on a particular issue,
   please ask in a comment.

## Code contributions

### Your first issue

1. Find an issue to work on. The best way is to look for the
   good first issue or help wanted labels.
2. Comment on the issue stating that you are going to work on it.
3. Create a fork of the repository and check out a branch with a name that
   describes your planned work. For example, `fix-documentation`.
4. Write code to address the issue or implement the feature.
5. Add unit tests and unit benchmarks.
6. Create your Pull Request. To run continuous integration (CI) tests without requesting review, open a draft pull request.
7. Verify that CI passes all status checks. Fix if needed.
8. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed.
9. Once reviewed and approved, a developer will merge your pull request.

If you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarification!

### Seasoned developers

Look at the unassigned issues, and find an issue to which you are comfortable contributing. Start
with _Step 3_ above, commenting on the issue to let others know you are working on it. If you have
any questions related to the implementation of the issue, ask them in the issue instead of the PR.

#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

* Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
